# A-Level Documents

This repository contains documentation I wrote as part of my A-Levels.

## Content
There are revision sheets in the subfolders of this repo. I cannot guarantee the content in them is correct, valid or even vaguely related. This content was developed to help *me* revise for *my* A-Levels, and that it did.

## Coursework Documents
The coursework documents I produced for some my courses are available in this repository. The content within them is mine. If you steal it - that is plagarism and you will get an accademic misconduct charge slapped across you quicker than you could just write your own. Don't steal my work.

There are some other supporting GitHub repositories containing code for my A-Levels:
