\label{chap:testPostDev}
Once I have finished programming my game, I will need to test all the elements of the app to ensure that I have (a) correctly programmed it, (b) there are no bugs, (c) the game meets my success criteria.

\section{User Acceptance Testing}
For the final testing for my project, I will ask some of my friends \& classmates who fit into the stakeholders category to test my project and give me feedback. Their findings are listed below and will be discussed in the Evaluation chapter.
\subsection{Findings from User Acceptance Testing}
]
\textbf{Liked:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item reasons for death
    \item the changes in lengths of life
    \item the random generation of names
    \item the random generation of crimes
    \item the random generation of jobs
    \item the silly death reasons
    \item \verb|TAB| key working to move between controls on character creation form
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Didn't like:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item that the same death could occur twice in the same game
    \item the death frequency
    \item the age gap possibilities between the partner and main character
    \item when main character died at age 1
    \item even if both the parents have died, the school events reference them
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Suggested Improvements:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item buttons need labels as well as icons
    \item make the label controls on the choice box clickable too
    \item neaten the 'Save \& Home' icon so they don't overlap
    \item the main character should automatically get a job when the turn 18
\end{itemize}
\end{multicols}

\subsection{Observations from User Acceptance Testing}
These are observations I made while watching other people play my game:
]
\begin{itemize}
    \item Quit band 1 jobs quite frequently
    \item Didn't attempt to edit the character
    \item Didn't say but inferred liked progress bars for score display
    \item Flicked between tabs lots
    \item Users struggled with using the app without any guidance or input from me
    \item Users stayed on the main page mostly, not interacting with other elements of the game
\end{itemize}
\end{multicols}
\subsection{Evidence of my testers testing}
Shown below are screenshots of direct messages with my testers, evidencing that they were involved in the user acceptance testing.
